=== NOTES

WIZARDS are referred to in this document as male
however WIZARDS should be some male and others female,
and any in-game text with pronouns (which is preferably avoided)
MUST substitute the proper pronoun

=== WORKFLOWS

PLAYER WORKFLOW

The PLAYER should arrive on the RULES

(this is for development version -- by the final version,
 EVERY rule should be sufficiently animated that the game
 is both readily playable and readily graspable
 by non-English-speakers)

The RULES are one splash page overlay, which is clicked through

During the match...

=== SPRITE ANIMATIONS

The WIZARD is normally idling (walking in place)

IDLING indicates agency, that is, the ability to
continue to match, bet, or defend.

When DEFENDING, the WIZARD stops walking, but stays
still in his neutral walking pose

Upon RAISING, the WIZARD raises his staff and then
	keeps it up until the next bet round starts;
	any WIZARDS who are all-in keep their staves raised
	(and thus, are also still, showing their fixed choice)

During CHOOSING, the WIZARD raises his staff and then
	keeps it up once his choice is made; shortly after
	the last WIZARD chooses, or when the timer expires,
	all spells are cast; WIZARDS who defaulted perform
	a hastened upswing after the timer expires and then
	immediately cast their default spell

Upon CASTING, the WIZARD sweeps his staff to forwards
and then keeps it forwards until all spells resolve
at which point everyone returns to idle walking


At the end of the RIVER, the WARP expands (for CHOOSING)
The WARP contracts slightly with each choosing, and then
significantly (from 50% to 0% expanded) after the final choice
